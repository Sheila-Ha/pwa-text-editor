## Description <!-- omit from toc -->
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. I have built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

  ### User Story

    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data      
  ### Acceptance Criteria
*  GIVEN a social network API

    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  

    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts  
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  

    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia  
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  

    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia  
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and delete friends to a user’s friend list

### Testing 
Insomnia - testing will be done using Insomnia
  - run npm run start
  - Make sure your mongoDB has the DB from the server.js and vice versa connected up

  - An example of a post user route: URL: 
    - [http://localhost:3001/api/users](http://localhost:3001/api/users)

      - {"username": "test4", "email": "test@test.com"}  
  
    - PUT update thought
